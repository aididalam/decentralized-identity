# Decentralized Identity Management System
A Decentralized Identity Management System allows users to securely store and share identity credentials on the blockchain. Users have full control over their data, and any credential verification can be done in a tamper-proof and efficient manner.

## Features

*   **User Registration**: Users can register and store their identity information securely.
*   **Credential Issuance**: Trusted authorities (e.g., government, universities) can issue credentials to users.
*   **Credential Verification**: Third parties can verify the authenticity of a user's credentials.
*   **Tamper-Proof Storage**: Immutable storage of credentials on the blockchain.
*   **Access Control**: Users can grant or revoke access to their data.
